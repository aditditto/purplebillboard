Right now I feel very disconnected. Perhaps it's because of the pandemic (well it's probably a very big factor) but that's how I feel. Especially as a university student, I feel like I am missing a huge portion of the experience. Before distance learning started, back in my freshman year, it was an everyday thing to pass by people I know and just, you know, greet them. Shoot the shit. And for me, that was very enjoyable. Hindsight is 20/20 I suppose, never take anything for granted.

What I'm trying to say is that organic interactions like that just isn't possible with the distanced everything of this current pandemic, and that makes me sad. It's a very fun(?) thing and just a big part of us humans as social animals. Also I suck a lot at texting which just puts me at a huge disadvantage when it comes to maintaining friendships/connections, which is probably something I should work on, because even after the pandemic life just pulls people apart and being able to text/communicate online efficiently is going to be a big factor for maintaining our connections with people from school/our past. Huh, that just hit me.
